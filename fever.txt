What is a fever?
A fever is when your body temperature rises higher than normal. A fever itself isn't an illness. Rather, it's a symptom of a wide range of health conditions. When your body temperature rises a few
degrees above normal, it can be a sign that your immune system has been activated, often to fight an infection. It can also be a side effect of some medications and vaccinations.
What is considered a fever?
Common knowledge states that a "normal" body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). But your baseline body temperature may vary by a degree or more. It also
fluctuates. It's typically lower in the morning and higher in the evening. It's higher during certain points of your menstrual cycle and when you're exercising.

Infants and young children normally have slightly higher body temperatures than older children and adults. So, infants and younger children have slightly higher fever temperatures.
There are no strict guidelines for what temperature is a fever, because body temperature varies by person, time of day and method of measurement. But healthcare providers most often say a fever temperature is 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C) when measured orally (by mouth).
Rectal and ear thermometers typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) higher than oral thermometers. Skin thermometers (such as forehead thermometers) typically
measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) lower than oral thermometers.
What is a low-grade fever?
A low-grade fever means a body temperature slightly above normal. This type of fever can be a sign your immune system has been mildly activated. There's no standard low-grade fever range. But many healthcare providers consider a body temperature between 99.5 degrees F (37.5 degrees C) and
100.3 degrees F (38.3 degrees C) to be a low-grade fever.
What are fever symptoms?
In addition to an elevated temperature, you may experience the following symptoms:
* Chills, feeling cold, shivering and shaking.
* Body aches and headaches.
* Fatigue (tiredness).
* On and off or constant sweating.
* Flushed complexion or hot skin.
* Faster heart beats.

Additional fever symptoms in babies and children may include:
* Lack of appetite - not eating and drinking well.
* Earache or pulling at their ears.
* High-pitched crying.
* Fussiness.

* Paleness or flushness.
* Excessive thirst.
* Decreased urination.
Possible Causes
What are the most common causes of fever?
A fever has many causes and can be a symptom of almost any illness. Common conditions that cause fever include:
* Bacterial infections.
* Viral infections such as influenza or COVID-19.
* Gastrointestinal (GI) infections.
* Urinary tract infections.
* Skin infections.
You may also develop a fever due to:
* A reaction to certain medications.
* Vaccinations.
* Autoimmune disorders.
* Cancer.

Can allergies cause fever?
Allergies can cause cold-like symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes, but they
typically don't cause fever. Despite its name, hay fever (also called allergic rhinitis) doesn't cause fever.
Care and Treatment
What's the best way to measure body temperature?
You can take your temperature in several different parts of your body. The most common site is your mouth (oral temperature). Other sites include your ear (tympanic membrane), forehead (temporal artery) and armpit (axillary). The most accurate site is the rectum, and the least accurate site is the armpit.
The best way to measure your temperature is with a digital thermometer. Glass thermometers contain mercury and providers no longer recommend them.
How can I break a fever at home?
If your fever is mild - less than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C) - you usually don't need treatment with medication. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids and get plenty of rest. Taking a lukewarm bath
- about 98 degrees F (36.7 degrees C) - may also help bring your body's temperature down. Keep an eye on signs of dehydration and other worsening symptoms.

If you're feeling uncomfortable and your temperature is higher than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C), you can try to break the fever. The most common way to get rid of a fever is to use over-the-counter (OTC) medications such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
including ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin.
Don't give aspirin to children under the age of 17. Aspirin in children may cause Reye's syndrome, a sometimes-fatal illness.
Does ibuprofen reduce fever?
Yes, you can take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen to try to reduce a fever.

How long does a fever last?
The cause of the fever determines how long it'll last. Typically, if an infection is the cause of your fever, it should pass within three to four days. Call your healthcare provider if the fever lingers longer than that or comes along with breathing changes.
Can fevers be prevented?
You can prevent some fevers by avoiding the illnesses and infections that cause them. Sometimes, children develop fevers after receiving vaccinations. You can prevent these types of fevers by giving your child acetaminophen just before or after the vaccination. But you can't prevent most fevers. They're typically a sign that your body is doing what it's supposed to do.
When To Call the Doctor
When should a fever be treated by a healthcare provider?
In adults, fevers less than 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C) typically aren't dangerous and aren't a cause for concern. If your fever rises above that level, make a call to your healthcare provider for treatment.
In children, call your child's healthcare provider if:
* Their fever lasts more than five days.
* Their fever is higher than 104 degrees F (40 degrees C).
* Medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen don't break the fever.
* You're concerned they aren't behaving normally.
* They have any problems breathing or urinating.
When should I go to the ER?
If you have a fever along with any of the following symptoms, go to your nearest emergency room or call 112. It may be a sign of a serious or life-threatening illness.
* Pain or tenderness in your belly (abdomen).
* Nausea or vomiting.
* Severe headache.
* Stif f neck.

* Light irritates your eyes (photophobia).
* Convulsions or seizures.
* Difficulty breathing.
* Strange behaviour and/or altered speech.
* Confusion or irritability.
* Difficulty waking or extreme sleepiness.
* Fever rash (small bleeding spots under your skin).
When should I take my child to the ER?
If your baby has a fever and is under 3 months of age, take them to the ER right away. Your baby's immune system hasn't developed fully yet, and they could have a serious infection.
If your child has a fever along with any of the following symptoms, call 112 or go to the nearest emergency room:
* Extreme sluggishness or drowsiness.
* Lack of appetite.
* Excessive drooling or difficulty swallowing.
* Continuous crying.
* Stiff neck.
* Fever rash.
* Difficulty breathing.
* Severe abdominal pain.
* Redness or swelling.
* Dehydration (not drinking many fluids).
* Decreased urination.
What are the possible complications or risks of not treating a fever?
Untreated fevers above 105.8 degrees F (41 degrees C) can be dangerous. If your body temperature reaches this level, your organs will begin to malfunction and will eventually fail.
Even moderate fevers can be dangerous for adults with lung or heart disorders because fever causes your breathing rate and heart rate to increase. Fever can also worsen the mental state of people
with dementia.

Fever is one of the body's most effective ways of fighting infection. It is part of your body's defence against infection-causing germs.
You get a fever most often when your body is trying to kill infectious invaders such as viruses or bacteria. A higher body temperature helps the immune system respond more vigorously to the attack, and makes it harder for these microbes to survive.

What is considered a fever in adults?
The average body temperature is 98.6° F (37°C). But "normal" body temperature varies from person to person. It also changes during the day, rising a bit after you eat or exercise. Body temperature is often higher in the afternoon than it is when you wake up in the morning.
Fever means a body temperature of 100.4° F (38°C) or higher. High fever in adults
While any temperature above your normal temperature range is considered a fever, there are different levels of fever severity:
* Low-grade: 99.1 to 100.4 F (37.3 to 38.0 C)
* Moderate-grade: 100.6 to 102.2 F (38.1 to 39.0 C)
   * High-grade: 102.4 to 105.8 F (39.1 to 41 C). When to worry about fever
If you have a fever over 104°F (40°C), you should call your doctor.
Seek medical help right away if you have a fever along with any of these symptoms:
* seizure
* loss of consciousness
* confusion
* stiff neck
* trouble breathing
* severe pain anywhere in the body
* swelling or inflammation of any part of the body
* vaginal discharge that is discoloured or smells bad
   * pain when urinating or urine that smells bad. Causes of fever
An infection, such as the flu, is the most common cause of fever.

Other conditions can also cause a fever. These include diseases that produce inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis; reactions to drugs or vaccines; and even certain types of cancers.

Accompanying symptoms
The following symptoms may also accompany fever:
* sweats
* chills
* headache

* achy muscles
* lack of desire to eat
* rash
* restlessness
* weakness.
A very high fever can cause confusion, extreme sleepiness, irritability, and seizures. Diagnosing the cause of a fever
To help determine why you have a fever, your doctor will ask you about:
* other symptoms such as coughing, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, or pain when urinating
* recent surgeries or injuries
* recent vaccinations
* new drugs you may be taking
   * recent travel, particularly travel abroad. How to treat a fever at home
By itself, fever is usually harmless, though a high fever can be miserable. These steps may help you feel better:
* Drink plenty of fluids to help cool your body and prevent dehydration.
* Eat light foods that are easy to digest.
* Get plenty of rest.
* Take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, or others), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, or others), or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) to help relieve head and body aches and lower your temperature.
* Take a slightly warm (not cool) bath, or apply damp washcloths to the forehead and wrists.


A fever is a temporary rise in body temperature. It's one part of an overall response from the body's immune system. A fever is usually caused by an infection.
For most children and adults, a fever may be uncomfortable. But it usually isn't a cause for concern. For infants, however, even a low fever may mean there's a serious infection.
Fevers generally go away within a few days. A number of over-the-counter medications lower a fever. But you don't necessarily need to treat a fever if it's not causing discomfort.


Symptoms

Body temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day. The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever.
Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include:
* Sweating
* Chills and shivering
* Headache
* Muscle aches
* Loss of appetite
* Irritability
* Dehydration
   * General weakness Taking a temperature
To take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers.
Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements.
In infants, a rectal temperature, if doable, is somewhat more accurate. When reporting a temperature to your health care provider, give both the reading and the type of thermometer used.


When to see a doctor
Fevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm - or a reason to call a doctor. Yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby, your child or yourself.
Infants and toddlers
A fever is a particular cause for concern in infants and toddlers. Call your baby's health care provider if your child is:
* Younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher.
* Between 3 and 6 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) or has a lower temperature but seems unusually irritable, sluggish or uncomfortable.
* Between 7 and 24 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms. If your child also has other signs and symptoms, such as a runny nose, cough or diarrhoea, you can call sooner.
Children

There's probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive. This means your child makes eye contact with you and responds to your facial expressions and to your voice. Your child may also be drinking fluids and playing.
Call your child's health care provider if your child:
* Is listless, confused or has poor eye contact with you.
* Is irritable, vomits repeatedly, has a severe headache, sore throat, stomach-ache or other symptoms causing a lot of discomfort.
* Has a fever after being left in a hot car. Seek medical care immediately.
* Has a fever that lasts longer than three days.
* Has a seizure associated with the fever. Call 112 if the seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't recover quickly.
Ask your child's health care provider for guidance in special circumstances, such as a child with immune system problems or with a preexisting illness.
Adults
Call your health care provider if your temperature is 103 F (39.4 C) or higher. Seek immediate medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms accompanies a fever:
* Severe headache
* Rash
* Unusual sensitivity to bright light
* Stiff neck and pain when you bend your head forward
* Mental confusion, strange behaviour or altered speech
* Persistent vomiting
* Difficulty breathing or chest pain
* Abdominal pain
* Pain when urinating
   * Convulsions or seizures Causes
Typical body temperature is a balance of heat production and heat loss. An area in the brain called the hypothalamus also known as your body's "thermostat" - monitors this balance. Even when you're healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day. It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.
When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher. This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss. The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat. When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat.

Fevers below 104 F (40 C) associated with common viral infections, such as the flu, may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful.
Fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by:
* A viral infection
* A bacterial infection
* Heat exhaustion
* Certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis - inflammation of the lining of your joints (synovium)
* A cancerous (malignant) tumour
* Some medications, such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures
* Some immunizations, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP), pneumococcal or COVID vaccine


Complications
Children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are at increased risk of a seizure that occurs during a fever (febrile seizure). About a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one, most commonly within the next 12 months.
A febrile seizure may involve loss of consciousness, shaking of limbs on both sides of the body, eyes rolling back or body stiffness. Although alarming for parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects.
If a seizure occurs:
* Lay your child on the side or stomach on the floor or ground
* Remove any sharp objects that are near your child
* Loosen tight clothing
* Hold your child to prevent injury
* Don't place anything in your child's mouth or try to stop the seizure
* Call 112 or your local emergency number if a seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't appear to recover well after the seizure
* Get emergency room or urgent care services if it's your child's first febrile seizure.
If your child doesn't need emergency care, see your child's health care provider as soon as possible for further evaluation.


Prevention

You may be able to prevent fevers by reducing exposure to infectious diseases. Here are some tips that can help:
* Get vaccinated as recommended for infectious diseases, such as influenza and COVID-19.
* Follow public health guidelines for wearing masks and social distancing.
* Wash your hands often and teach your children to do the same, especially before eating, after using the toilet, after spending time in a crowd or around someone who's sick, after petting animals, and during travel on public transportation.
* Show your children how to wash their hands thoroughly, covering both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinsing completely under running water.
* Carry hand sanitizer with you for times when you don't have access to soap and water.
* Try to avoid touching your nose, mouth or eyes, as these are the main ways that viruses and bacteria can enter your body and cause infection.
* Cover your mouth when you cough and your nose when you sneeze, and teach your children to do the same. Whenever possible, turn away from others and cough or sneeze into your elbow to avoid passing germs along to them.
   * Avoid sharing cups, water bottles and utensils with your child or children. Diagnosis
To evaluate a fever, your care provider may:
* Ask questions about your symptoms and medical history
* Perform a physical exam
* Take nasal or throat samples to test for respiratory infections
* Order tests, such as blood tests or a chest X-ray, as needed, based on your medical history and physical exam
Because a fever can indicate a serious illness in a young infant, especially two months of age or younger, your baby might be admitted to the hospital for testing and treatment.
Fever of unknown origin
When a fever lasts for more than three weeks - constantly or on several occasions - and there is no clear cause, it's usually called a fever of unknown origin. In these cases, you may need to see specialists in one or more medical fields for further evaluations and tests.
Treatment
For a low-grade fever, your care provider may not recommend taking medications to lower your body temperature. These minor fevers may be helpful in reducing the number of microbes causing your illness. Fevers above 102 F (38.9 C) tend to cause discomfort and often require treatment.
Over-the-counter medications

In the case of a high fever or a fever that causes discomfort, your care provider may recommend nonprescription medication, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others).
Use these medications according to the label instructions or as recommended by your health care provider. Be careful not to take too much. High doses or long-term use of acetaminophen or ibuprofen may cause liver or kidney damage, and acute overdoses can be fatal. Don't give aspirin to children, because it may trigger a rare, but potentially fatal, disorder known as Reye's syndrome.
These medications will usually lower your temperature, but you may still have a mild fever. It may take 1 to 2 hours for the medication to work. Call your care provider if your fever doesn't improve, even after taking medication.
Prescription medications
Your health care provider may prescribe other medications based on the cause of your illness. Treating the underlying cause may lessen signs and symptoms, including fever.
Treatment of infants
Infants, especially those younger than two months old, might need to be admitted to the hospital for testing and treatment. In babies this young, a fever could indicate a serious infection that requires intravenous (IV) medications and round-the-clock monitoring.


Self-care
You can try a number of things to make yourself or your child more comfortable during a fever:
* Drink plenty of fluids. Drinking fluids will improve heat loss from the skin and replace water lost through sweating. Water and clear broth are healthy choices. Infants under 6 months should only have breast milk or formula.
* Rest. You need rest to recover, and activity can raise your body temperature.
* Stay cool. If you aren't shivering, dress in light clothing, keep the room temperature cool, and sleep with only a sheet or light blanket.




What is a Fever?


A fever is a body temperature that is higher than average. It's typically a sign of an immune system's natural response to an infection or a virus.
A person's average normal body temperature is 98.6° Fahrenheit. For adults, a fever is when your body temperature is above 100.4°F. For children, a fever is a body temperature higher than 99.5°F (taken orally), 99°F (taken under the arm), or 100.4°F (taken rectally).

Fevers show that your body is working to fight off a virus or infection-a normal and healthy response. Most fevers can be treated at home, but there are certain situations where a fever can be cause for concern.
Types of Fevers
A fever is traditionally categorized by how high your temperature is and how long it lasts. There are five general types of fever, including:
* Intermittent fever - This type of fever fluctuates between normal body temperature and higher-than-normal levels through the day
* Remittent fever - Like intermittent fever, this fever fluctuates throughout the day, but never falls all the way back to a baseline normal temperature
* Hectic fever - With hectic fever, temperatures swing severely throughout the day, with a difference of at least 1.4 degrees Celsius between the lowest and highest measurements. A remittent or intermittent fever can be considered hectic.
* Continuous (or sustained) fever - Continuous fever is a steady, prolonged fever, with no change or slight fluctuations throughout the day
* Relapsing fever - This type is an intermittent fever that spikes again after days or weeks of having a normal body temperature
Fevers can be considered mild, moderate, or high. What constitutes a fever temperature-wise varies between adults, children 11 and younger, kids 12 and older.

Fevers in infants (0 to 3 months) and sustained fevers in children, especially those under 2, warrant a call to your paediatrician.

Signs & Symptoms of Fevers
Fever symptoms vary depending on the type of fever, the temperature, and the cause. A fever in adults can produce different symptoms than children may have.
Beyond an elevated body temperature, fever symptoms can include:
* Chills or shivering
* Sweating
* Headaches
* Body aches
* Fatigue
* Feeling dehydrated
* Loss of appetite
* Hot skin to the touch
* Flushed complexion
A primary care doctor or your child's general paediatrician can help address these symptoms, locate the cause, and recommend a specialist or emergency care when necessary.

Contact your paediatric doctor if your baby is under 3 months and develops a fever. Conditions with fever as a symptom
A fever can be an indicator of many kinds of health issues, ranging from mild infections to severe diseases. Conditions that can have fever as a symptom include:
* Cold or flu
* Infections, including of the ear, throat, skin, kidney or bladder
* COVID-19
* Strep throat
* Bronchitis
* Urinary tract infections (UTI)
* Inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis
* Mononucleosis
* Blood clots
* Autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBS) and lupus
* Cancer
   * Hyperthyroidism and other hormone disorders When to see a doctor
Fevers are common and typically don't require medical attention. They are a sign of a health issue, however, so it's important to pay attention to your symptoms and know when to get help.
If your child has a fever, contact a physician if the following criteria applies or these symptoms appear:
* Your baby is younger than three months old
* A fever lasts longer than three days
* Your child is confused, listless, or has trouble making eye contact
* Your child vomits repeatedly
* Has ear pain or tugs on their ear
* Develops a fever after being left in a hot car
* Has a fever-related seizure
Seek medical attention for an adult fever right away if accompanied by the following symptoms:
* Stiff neck
* Irritability or confusion
* Seizure

* Severe headache
* Dehydration (no tears, less urine, sunken eyes)
* Severe light sensitivity. (Photophobia)
* A rash
* Pain when urinating
* Abdominal pain
* Trouble breathing
* Vomiting
* A fever above 103°F lasting more than two hours after taking fever-reducing medicine
Any adult fever above 105°F that doesn't respond to home medication could be life-threatening. Call 112 immediately.
What Causes a Fever?
Your body's temperature is balanced by the area of the brain called the hypothalamus-your own interior thermostat. The hypothalamus makes temperature adjustments when the body encounters certain conditions, occasionally resulting in an elevated body temperature.
Fever causes can include:
* Viral infection
* Bacterial infection
* Immunization and vaccines
* Medication side effects
* Teething in babies (low-grade, lower than 102°)
* Heat exhaustion
   * Sunburn Complications
Most fevers subside on their own or with the help of fever-reducing remedies. But high, persistent fevers, or fevers that worsen over time, can result in brain damage or even death.
Febrile or fever seizures are convulsions in children that a fever spike can cause. Fever seizures are not the same as epileptic seizures, lasting for 1 to 3 minutes, and are generally not serious.
Prevention
Anyone can develop a fever, but avoiding getting sick is the best way to prevent one. You can help prevent infections and other causes of fever by doing the following:
* Wash your hands
* Avoid sharing silverware, cups, and other dining materials

* Avoid touching your face
* Get vaccinated against infectious diseases, including the flu and COVID-19
* Carry hand sanitizer/wipes with you


What is a fever?
A fever is a body temperature that is higher than normal. It often means there is an abnormal process occurring in the body. Exercise, hot weather, and vaccines can also make body temperature rise.
What causes a fever?
A fever is not an illness by itself. Rather, it is a symptom that something is not right within the body. A fever does not tell you what is causing it, or even that a disease is present. It may be a bacterial or viral infection. Or it could be a reaction from an allergy to food or medicine. Becoming overheated at play or in the sun can also result in fever. There are many other causes of fever as well.
What are the symptoms of a fever?
Normal body temperature ranges from 97.5°F to 99.5°F (36.4°C to 37.4°C). It tends to be lower in the morning and higher in the evening. Most healthcare providers consider a fever to be 100.4°F (38°C) or higher. A person with a temperature of 99.6°F to 100.3°F has a low-grade fever. High
fevers may bring on seizures or confusion in children. It's not how high the temperature is but how fast the temperature goes up that causes a seizure.
A fever has other symptoms besides a higher-than-normal temperature. These are especially important when caring for babies, young children, and disabled people. These groups may not be able to express how they feel. Signs that mean fever include:
* Flushed face
* Hot, dry skin
* Low output of urine, or dark urine
* Not interested in eating
* Constipation or diarrhoea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Aching all over
* Nausea
How is a fever diagnosed?
The best way to diagnose a fever is to take a temperature with a thermometer. There are several types of thermometers, such as:
* Digital thermometer (oral, rectal, or under the armpit)

* Tympanic (ear) thermometer (not recommended in babies younger than 6 months of age)
* Temporal artery (temperature taken across the forehead area)
Taking a temperature rectally is the most accurate method in children younger than 3 years of age. In older children and adults, take the temperature under the armpit or in the mouth. Talk with your healthcare provider about the best way to take your temperature.
Mercury thermometers
Most thermometers today are digital. But there are some glass thermometers containing mercury still in use. Mercury is a toxic substance. It is dangerous to humans and the environment. Because glass thermometers can break, they should be disposed of in accordance with local, state, and federal laws. For information on how to safely dispose of a mercury thermometer, contact your local health department, waste disposal authority, or fire department.
If a mercury thermometer breaks, have everyone leave the area, including pets. Open all windows and doors to the outside. But shut all doors to the rest of the house. Make certain pregnant women leave the area. Call your local poison control centre at 800-222-1222. They will tell you how to clean up the mercury. Don't let children help clean up the spill. Don't use a vacuum cleaner or broom to clean up the droplets. Don't pour mercury down a drain.
How is a fever treated?
You can treat a fever with acetaminophen or ibuprofen in doses advised by your healthcare provider. Switching between giving acetaminophen and ibuprofen can cause medicine errors and may lead to side effects. But it sometimes works better than using only one or the other. Never give aspirin to a child or young adult who has a fever. Aspirin can cause an upset stomach and intestinal bleeding. It may also cause Reye syndrome. This is a rare but very serious illness that can affect all organs of the body. But it most often injures the brain and the liver.
A lukewarm bath may reduce the fever. Alcohol rubdowns are no longer recommended.
Call your healthcare provider for guidance anytime you are concerned about a fever. Also call your healthcare provider if a temperature spikes quickly or lasts despite treatment.
When should I call my healthcare provider?
Call your healthcare provider right away for a fever in a baby younger than 3 months old. Call or get medical care right away if any of these occur with a fever:
* Seizure
* Feeling dull or sleepy
* Irregular breathing
* Stiff neck
* Confusion
* Purple spotted rash
* Ear pain (a child tugging on his or her ear)
* Sore throat that doesn't go away

* Vomiting
* Diarrhoea
   * Painful, burning, or frequent urination Key points about fevers
* A fever is not an illness by itself. Rather, it's a sign that something is not right within the body.
* Illness, exercise, hot weather, and vaccines can make body temperature rise.
* In addition to an elevated temperature, look for other signs, such as: flushed face, hot skin, low urine output, loss of appetite, headache, or other symptoms of an infection or illness.
* Once you have determined that the person has a fever, you may treat it by giving acetaminophen or ibuprofen in doses advised by your healthcare provider. Never give aspirin to a child or teen who has a fever.
* Call your healthcare provider if a baby younger than 3 months has a fever. Or get medical care right away if a fever occurs with a seizure, lethargy, irregular breathing, stiff neck, confusion, or other signs of a serious illness.


What is a normal body temperature?
A normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit or 37 degrees Celsius. At least, that's the conventional answer. However, studies suggest that the actual body temperature of humans may run closer to 97.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Still, according to the Journal of Infection and Public Health, the normal body temperature usually ranges between 98.6 and 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit.

There are a few important considerations regarding body temperatures, though. A person's temperature can be influenced by several factors, including:
* Strenuous exercise
* Stress
* Smoking
* Gender
* Pregnancy
* Food and drinks
* Weather
* Time of day when the temperature is taken
Remember that body temperatures can vary based on where the measurement is taken. Rectal and ear temperatures are higher (and more accurate) than oral and armpit temperatures.
It's also important to consider the age of the person. In children, the normal temperature can differ from that of adults.

The average normal oral temperature is 98.6°F (37°C).
* A rectal temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature.
* An ear temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature.
* An armpit temperature is most often 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature.
* A forehead scanner is most often 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature
What is a fever?
So, what constitutes a fever? Depending on where you look, you might find different values for what is considered a fever. The answer is it depends, as everyone's body runs at a slightly different normal temperature. The average body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and anything above 100.4 F usually indicates a fever.
Fever symptoms
A fever is usually a symptom in and of itself caused by an infection or other condition. But a fever often occurs along with other signs and symptoms. These might include:
* Headache
* Muscle aches
* Dehydration
* Chills or shivering
* Fatigue
* Flushing of the skin
* Sweating
* Weakness
* Changes in appetite
In some cases, a fever can develop without other symptoms. The symptoms that develop with a fever will depend on the condition or infection causing the fever in the first place.
Types of fevers
Fevers can be described in a number of ways, such as low-grade, moderate-grade, or high-grade. The range that a fever can fall within can vary depending on a person's normal body temperature. However, a fever is usually classified as follows:
* Low-grade fever: 100.5 to 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit
* Moderate-grade fever: 102.2 to 104.0 degrees Fahrenheit
* High-grade fever: 104.1 to 106.0 degrees Fahrenheit

Hyperpyrexia occurs when the body's temperature rises over 106 degrees Fahrenheit and indicates a severe underlying issue that requires emergency medical care. If it's not controlled, an extremely high temperature can potentially cause permanent brain damage and even death. Symptoms that accompany hyperpyrexia include nausea, vomiting, headache, and confusion, which often require medical attention.
The timeline of symptoms can also dictate how a fever is classified. An acute fever lasts less than seven days, a subacute fever lasts between seven and 14 days, and a chronic fever lasts more than 14 days. Some fevers may also have different patterns. For example, an intermittent fever is a fever that occurs only for several hours during a 24-hour period.
Fever temperature chart
Normal and febrile body temperature ranges (rectal temperatures):
* Normal body temperature would be 37 to 38 degrees Celsius or 98.6 to 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit
* Mild/low grade fever would be 38.1 to 39 degrees Celsius or 100.5 to 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit
* Moderate grade fever would be 39.1 to 40 degrees Celsius or 102.2 to 104.0 degrees Fahrenheit
* High grade fever would be 40.1 to 41.1 degrees Celsius or 104.1 to 106.0 degrees Fahrenheit
* Hyperpyrexia would be greater than 41.1 degrees Celsius or 106.0 degrees Fahrenheit
* 
Causes of fevers
Fevers can be caused by an array of different problems, and knowing the underlying cause is important to treat a fever. Examples of fever causes include:
* Viral or bacterial infections
* Medication side effects
* Vaccines
* Blood clots
* Severe sunburn
* Certain inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn's disease
* Cancer
* Teething (in infants)
Any of these conditions or illnesses may trigger a fever through different immune processes.
However, the hypothalamus is the part of the brain that regulates the body's temperature. In tandem with processes in the immune system, the hypothalamus can increase the temperature of the body.
A fever can also develop due to hyperthermia, which occurs when the body is unable to regulate
its temperature. In a high-heat environment, the body's temperature-regulating systems can break down. Unable to release more heat than it can absorb, the body can overheat.

Body temperature chart for children:
* Hypothermia would be less than 35.0 38 degrees Celsius or less than 95.0 degrees Fahrenheit.
* Normal temperature would be between 35.8 to 37.5 38 degrees Celsius or 96.4 to 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit
* Hyperthermia (low grade fever) would have a temperature greater than 38.0 degrees Celsius or greater than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit
* Hyperpyrexia (high fever) would have a temperature greater than 40.0 degrees Celsius or greater than 104.0 degrees Fahrenheit
Body temperature for adults:
* Hypothermia would have a temperature less than 35.0 degrees Celsius or lee than 95.0 degrees Fahrenheit
* Normal temperature lies between 36.5 to 37.5 degrees Celsius or between 97.7 to 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit
* Hyperthermia (low grade fever) would have a temperature greater than 38.3 degrees Celsius or greater than 100.9 degrees Fahrenheit
* Hyperpyrexia (high fever) would have a temperature greater than 41.5 degrees Celsius or greater than 106.7 degrees Fahrenheit
Note: These charts reflect rectal temperatures, which are typically one degree (Fahrenheit) higher than oral or armpit temperatures.
Treating a fever
In most cases, a fever will come and go without doing any harm. Because they help the body fight off infections, it's often best to let low-grade fevers run their course. A fever will usually last one to three days. However, if the fever gets worse or remains persistent, it may be time to seek help from a healthcare provider.
Although a high-grade fever may require more serious measures, a mild- to moderate-grade fever can usually be treated at home with the following:
Getting plenty of rest
Rest is critical for allowing the body to recover and fight the underlying cause of the fever. Keeping physical activity to a minimum can also help prevent any sudden spikes in body temperature.
Keeping the body hydrated
Fevers can induce sweating, so staying hydrated is vital. Drinking cold water won't always lower a high temperature, but it can help mitigate symptoms and discomfort. Other ways to stay hydrated include drinking clear broth, or juice. Children under six months of age should only be given formula or breast milk.
Staying cool and comfortable
Dressing in airy clothing, using light blankets, and taking lukewarm baths can help keep the body cool and comfortable. It might seem like an ice bath would tackle a fever even better, but this isn't the case. Ice baths can cause shivering, which could raise core body temperature.
Over-the-counter medications

Over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen (Advil) and acetaminophen (Tylenol) are effective in reducing fevers. They can also help relieve mild discomfort, aches, and pains associated with fevers. Just make sure to check the drug label or consult with a healthcare provider for proper dosages and instructions in children.
Prescription drugs
A healthcare provider may prescribe a prescription medication, such as an antibiotic, to address the underlying cause of the fever. A fever and other symptoms should start to subside with antibiotics if a bacterial infection is causing the fever.

When to call a doctor
Dealing with a fever can be a stressful experience. Usually, there should be no reason to panic with a fever. However, it's good to keep some things in mind regarding when you should seek medical attention for a fever.
Fever is also one of the most common COVID-19 symptoms. Anyone with a fever and a dry cough or difficulty breathing should get tested for coronavirus as soon as possible.

Fever in adults
Certain scenarios may call for a visit to a healthcare provider. You should seek help from a
healthcare provider or, in some cases, go straight to an emergency room if you experience any of the following with a fever.
* Fever with a body temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit or higher
* Severe chest pain
* Difficulty breathing
* Severe confusion or changes in behaviour
* Severe headache
* Stiffness or pain in the neck when bending the head forward
* Dizziness or light-headedness
* Seizures
* Skin rash
* Pain around the abdomen
* Severe nausea and vomiting that doesn't go away
   * Pain upon urination Fever in children and infants
Children and infants have lower temperature thresholds for fevers because of the potential damage they can cause. You should monitor your child's fever closely and seek help from a healthcare provider if you find any of the following:

* A temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) or more in an infant younger than three months old
* A temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.9 degrees Celsius) or more in an infant between three and six months old
   * A fever that lasts longer than two days in an infant or child older than three months Accompanying symptoms of a fever, such as:
* Severe or unusual rash
* Appearing confused or listless
* Severe fatigue or drowsiness
* Difficulty breathing
* No longer eating or drinking
* Irritability
* Vomiting
Children and infants may also experience febrile seizures in severe cases. These seizures may cause uncontrollable shaking or a loss of consciousness. If a seizure lasts more than five minutes, call 112 immediately.


fever is a rise in body temperature. It's often a sign of infection. Fever itself most often is harmless and it may play a role in fighting infection. Most fevers don't need treatment.
The average body temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit (37 Celsius). But typical body temperature can range between 97 F (36.1 C) and 99 F (37.2 C) or more. Your body temperature can vary by how active you are, your age or the time of day. Most often, older people have lower body
temperatures than younger people have.
These thermometer readings are thought to be a fever:
* Rectal, ear or temporal artery temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher.
* Oral temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher.
   * Armpit temperature of 99 F (37.2 C) or higher. When to seek emergency care
For a baby who's less than 3 months old and has a fever, get medical help right away.
Also, seek emergency medical care for a child who has any of these symptoms after being left in a hot car. These may be symptoms of a heat-related illness.
* Fever with no sweating or heavy sweating.
* Bad headache.
* Seizures.

* Stiff neck.
* Confusion.
* Repeated vomiting or diarrhoea.
* Being irritable.
   * Any symptoms that worry you. Treatment
The main goal of treatment is to improve comfort and help you or your child rest. Infant and child
Children with fevers may not look or act sick. Treating a fever depends on how uncomfortable they are. If your child is uncomfortable or restless, these home care strategies may help:
* Have your child drink fluids.
* Dress your child in light clothing.
* Use a light blanket if your child feels chilled, until the chills end.
* If your child is 6 months old or older, give your child acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others). Read the label carefully for proper dosing. If your child has other health problems or takes medicine for them, check with your healthcare professional before using fever medicines.
Adult
Adults with fevers of 103 F (39.4 C) or higher will most often look and act sick. To treat a fever:
* Drink plenty of fluids.
* Dress in light clothing.
* Use a light blanket if you feel chilled, until the chills end.
* Take acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others). Follow the directions on the label. If you have other health problems or take medicine for them, check with your healthcare professional before using fever medicines.
What to avoid
* Don't give aspirin to children or teenagers.
* Don't give an infant any type of pain reliever until after you've talked with a healthcare professional.
When to call your doctor
Seek medical care if a child of any age shows any of the following:
* Fussiness or unusual behaviour that doesn't improve even after taking medicine to bring down the fever.

* Symptoms of water loss, called dehydration. These include no wet diapers over 8 to 10 hours, crying without tears, a dry mouth or refusing to drink fluids.
* Stiff neck or a headache.
* Belly pain.
* Trouble breathing.
* Rash.
* Joint pain or swelling.
* Fever that lasts more than five days.
Seek medical care for an adult with a fever and any of the following:
* Trouble breathing.
* Chest pain.
* Bad headache or stiff neck.
* Being confused.
* Belly pain.
* Repeated vomiting.
* Symptoms of water loss, called dehydration. These include having a dry mouth, making less or dark urine, or not drinking fluids.
* Skin rashes.
* Trouble swallowing fluids.
   * Pain with passing urine or pain in the back. How to take a temperature
Always use a digital thermometer to check someone's temperature. Types you can get include:
* Rectal thermometers for use in the rectum.
* Oral thermometers for use in the mouth.
* Temporal artery thermometers. These use an infrared scanner to measure the temperature of the temporal artery in the forehead.
* Armpit, called axillary, and ear, called tympanic membrane thermometers. These are less accurate.
Because of the dangers of being exposed to mercury, don't use a glass mercury thermometer. No matter which type of thermometer you use, do the following when using it:
* Read the instructions that came with the thermometer.
* Clean the thermometer before and after each use with rubbing alcohol or soap and lukewarm water.

* Don't use the same thermometer for both oral and rectal temperatures. Get two and label which is used were.
   * Never leave children alone while taking their temperature. Rectal temperature (for infants)
* Turn on the digital thermometer and dab petroleum jelly or another lubricant on the tip of the thermometer.
* Lay the child on his or her stomach or side, with knees flexed.
* Carefully insert the tip 1/2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 centimetres) into the rectum.
* Hold the thermometer and the child still until the thermometer beeps, which means it's done. To avoid injury, don't let go of the thermometer while it's inside the child.
   * Remove the thermometer and read the number. Oral temperature
* Turn on the digital thermometer. Place the thermometer tip under the tongue.
* Close the mouth around the thermometer for as long as instructed or until the thermometer beeping shows it's done.
   * Remove the thermometer and read the number. Temporal artery temperature
* Turn on the digital thermometer. Gently sweep it across the forehead and read the number.
Armpit temperature
* Turn on the digital thermometer. Place the thermometer under the armpit, making sure it touches skin, not clothing.
* Hold the thermometer tightly in place until you hear the thermometer beep, which means it's done.
   * Remove the thermometer and read the number. Ear temperature
* Turn on the digital thermometer. Gently place it in the ear canal only as far as the instructions that came with the device say to.
* Hold the thermometer tightly in place until you hear the thermometer beep, which means it's done.
   * Remove the thermometer and read the number. What Abnormal Results Mean
If the reading on the thermometer is more than 1 to 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit above your normal temperature, you have a fever. Fevers may be a sign of:

* Blood clots
* Cancer
* Certain types of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus
* Diseases in the intestines, such as Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis
* Infection (both serious and non-serious)
   * Many other medical problems Body temperature can also be raised by:
* Being active
* Being in a high temperature or high humidity
* Eating
* Feeling strong emotions
* Menstruating
* Taking certain medicines
* Teething (in a young child -- but no higher than 100°F [37.7°C])
* Wearing heavy clothing
Body temperature that is too high or too low can be serious. Contact your provider if this is the case.
Possible causes of fever
Several conditions, including diseases and infections, can lead to a fever.
Additional symptoms often paint a clearer picture of what is causing a fever. Possible causes may include the following:
COVID-19
A fever is one of the symptoms of COVID-19Trusted Source. Additional indicators may include:
* coughing
* fatigue
* shortness of breath
* loss of taste and smell
* muscle aches
Learn more about the symptoms, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19 here.

Common infections
Various other types of viral and bacterial infections can also trigger a fever, which include:
* seasonal flu

* strep throat
* urinary tract infections
   * gastroenteritis Cancer
A fever can indicate certain types of blood cancers, including lymphoma.

Health experts believe that cancer cells produce chemical signals that increase body temperature, leading to a fever.
Heatstroke
Heat-related illnesses, such as heatstroke, can increase temperature and trigger a fever.

Traumatic injuries and pain
A fever can also occur after trauma to the body that causes pain.
Healthcare professionals state that trauma can trigger the release Trusted Source of prostaglandins and cytokines by the white blood cells, which may cause an increase in body temperature.
Fever may also develop after cardiac arrest. Drug use
Withdrawal from alcohol and amphetamine use can increase body temperature and lead to a fever.
Certain types of prescription medications, such as drugs to treat seizures, may also cause a fever as a side effect.
When to seek help
It is not always necessary to seek medical care for a fever, especially if it is low grade or only lasts a short time.
However, there are some circumstances where a person should seek medical help, such as the following:
* a fever in a baby younger than 3 months
* a baby becomes lethargic
* a fever higher than 103°F (39.4°C)
* a fever that comes and goes for a week or more
* a fever that lasts for more than 2 days
* if additional symptoms occur, such as:
o confusion
o trouble breathing
o severe headache

o dehydration

Fever, or pyrexia, is the elevation of an individual's core body temperature above a 'set-point' regulated by the body's thermoregulatory centre in the hypothalamus. This increase in the body's 'set-point' temperature is often due to a physiological process brought about by infectious causes or non-infectious causes such as inflammation, malignancy, or autoimmune processes. These processes involve the release of immunological mediators, which trigger the thermoregulatory centre of the hypothalamus, leading to an increase in the body's core temperature.
The normal temperature of the human body is approximately 37 degrees Celsius (C), or 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (F), and varies by about 0.5 C throughout the day. This variation in the core body temperature results from normal physiological processes throughout the human body, including metabolic changes, sleep/wake cycles, hormone variability, and changing activity levels. However, in the case of a fever, the increase in the core body temperature is often greater than 0.5 C and is attributed to a fever-inducing substance (pyrogen).
While these numbers may vary slightly based on the source, below is a summary of how to categorize fever.
* Low-grade: 37.3 to 38.0 C (99.1 to 100.4 F)
* Moderate-grade: 38.1 to 39.0 C (100.6 to 102.2 F)
* High-grade: 39.1 to 41 C (102.4 to 105.8 F)
* Hyperthermia: Greater than 41 C (105.8 F)
It is essential to understand that the definition of fever is not the same as that of hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia). In fever, there is an increase in the 'set-point' temperature brought about by the hypothalamus, enabling the body to maintain a controlled increase in the core temperature and general functionality of all organ systems. In hyperthermia, however, the rise in the body's core temperature is beyond the confines of the set-point temperature and regulation of the
hypothalamus. Issues of Concern
An issue of concern that should be addressed when discussing the concept of fever
is understanding that the site of measurement influences body temperature readings. The average axillary temperature reading is 35.97 degrees C (96.75 degrees F), oral is 36.57 degrees C (97.83 degrees F), urine is 36.61 degrees C (97.90 degrees C), tympanic is 36.64 degrees C (97.95 degrees F), and rectal is 37.04 degrees C (98.67 degrees F).
It is also important to consider the patient's normal baseline body temperature. If a patient
typically runs "cold" or "hot," then their baseline body temperature may be decreased or elevated above what is considered "normal" and does not necessarily indicate a fever or febrile illness.
A final issue of concern is that, while patients can state they have a fever because they "feel warm," it is noted that the diagnosis of fever based on palpation is unreliable and inaccurate in up to 40% of individuals. If a fever is suspected, an official reading should be obtained.
Organ Systems Involved
Fever induction in humans occurs at a high metabolic cost, such that only a 1 C rise in body temperature requires a 10-12.5% increase in metabolic rate.

Metabolic effects associated with a febrile state:
* Increased oxygen demand
o Increased heart rate
o Increased respiratory rate
* Increased use of body proteins as an energy source
* Metabolism switches from utilizing glucose (an excellent medium for bacterial growth) to utilizing the breakdown products of protein and fat
* Enhanced immune function
o Increase in the motility and activity of white blood cells
o Stimulates interferon production and activation of T cells
* Growth inhibition of specific microbial agents
o Many microbial agents that cause infection tend to grow at normal body temperatures
A sustained, severely elevated fever can lead to lethal effects within multiple organ systems:
* Brain
o Acute neurologic and cognitive function may occur after an episode of hyperthermia, with approximately 50% of heatstroke survivors experiencing
chronic neurologic damage. Specifically, the Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex are sensitive to heat damage, which can lead to long-lasting cerebellar dysfunction.
* Cardiovascular
o Acutely, a hyperthermic patient will tend to be hypotensive with a high cardiac output due to blood redistribution and nitric-oxide-induced vasoconstriction. In severe fever, such as heatstroke, an electrocardiogram may show T-wave abnormalities, QT and ST changes, and conduction defects. In addition, serum
troponin I levels may be significantly raised.
* Gastrointestinal
o Above 40 C (104 F), there is a reduction in blood flow to the GI tract. In addition, oxidative stress, denatured proteins, and damaged cell membranes are evident, increasing the potential for releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, GI inflammation, and edema.
* Liver
o Elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT) are observed in individuals with body
temperatures above 40 C, with severe cases leading to permanent hepatocellular damage requiring a liver transplant. It is important to note that liver function may continue to decline even after correcting hyperthermia. For this reason, a clinician should trend the patient's liver enzymes to ensure no ongoing liver damage exists.
* Kidney

o Patients with an increased body temperature are at a significantly greater risk for acute kidney injury (AKI). An increase in body temperature by only 2 C leads to a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which continues to fall with a
further rise in temperature. Lab studies will show an increase in plasma creatinine and urea. Additionally, a hyperthermic state stimulates the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system (RAAS), leading to a subsequent reduction in blood flow to the kidney.
* Hemostasis
o Inhibition of platelet aggregation, spontaneous bleeding, increased clotting times, thrombocytopenia, and increased plasma fibrin degradation productions are classically seen in hyperthermic patients.
Function
The fever response is a systemic reaction to an infection that has evolved in warm-blooded animals for over 600 million years. An increase in core body temperature is known to improve survival and resolve infections. While an increased body temperature subsequently leads to an increased metabolic cost, it is known that the survival benefits outweigh the metabolic cost associated with a fever. An increase in core body temperature acts as an alert system to activate immune surveillance via different cell types, including natural killer cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, T and B lymphocytes, neutrophils, and vascular endothelial cells.


Patients with fever usually exhibit warm, flushed skin, tachycardia, involuntary muscular
contractions or rigors, and sweating or night sweats. Piloerection and positioning of the body to minimize exposed surface area are also seen. Occasionally these signs are absent or minimal, and dry, cold skin or extremities are detected despite a significant rise in core temperature.


Heat Exhaustion: Temperature above 38 degrees C (100 degrees F) in the presence of any of the following symptoms
* Increased sweating
* Pale, clammy, cold skin
* Generalized weakness
* Tachycardia with weak pulse
* Nausea or vomiting
* Dizziness, light-headedness, or fainting
Heat Stroke: Temperature above 40 degrees C (104 degrees F) in the presence of any of the following symptoms
* Hot, red, dry skin
* Tachycardia with a strong pulse
* Delirium, convulsions, or coma

A fever, also called pyrexia, is characterized by a temporary rise in body temperature. A body temperature of 100-100.4 degrees is what healthcare providers consider a fever in adults. An oral temperature of 99.5 degrees or a rectal temperature of 100.4 degrees is a fever in infants and children.
A fever is a common COVID-19 symptom.4 Research has found that people with COVID-19 may have a 98.9-100.6-degree fever. The only way to know if COVID-19 is the cause of your fever is to receive a test.
A fever is not a disease but typically means your body is fighting an infection. Bacteria and viruses that cause infections thrive in a normal body temperature. A fever results from your body trying to get rid of the invader by making your body an inhospitable environment for it. A fever starts an immune response, which defends you against the invader.
Autoimmune diseases, early-stage cancer, heat illness, and some medicines (i.e., antibiotics) may also cause a fever. Sometimes, children develop a low-grade fever after getting a vaccine.
Is 99 Considered a Fever for COVID-19?
A low-grade fever may range between 99.1-100.4 degrees, so a 99-degree fever may be an early sign of COVID-19. A review published in 2021 noted that 19% of studies that identified fever as a COVID-19 symptom described an elevated body temperature ranging from 98.9-100.6 degrees.
The researchers noted that there's no clear definition of what a fever for COVID-19 is. The only way to know if COVID-19 is the cause of your fever is to receive a test. The CDC advises getting tested right away if you have COVID-19 symptoms, including a fever. Begin self-isolation right away if you test positive.
Isolate for at least five days, with day zero being when your fever-or other COVID-19 symptoms- began. You are most contagious during that time, so wear a high-quality mask if you must be around others in your household. You may end self-isolation after five days if you do not have a fever for at least 24 hours without using a fever reducer.
For example, a low-grade fever is a body temperature above normal but not above or just barely above the fever threshold. A low-grade fever typically ranges between 99.1 and 100.4 degrees in adults and children.
Still, that's "not a true fever," said Dr. Grimes. In contrast, a low-grade fever in infants, slightly elevated but not quite 100.4 degrees, may be a sign of infection.
Fever Symptoms
Fever symptoms typically depend on how high your body temperature is, Matthew Mintz, MD, an internist based in Maryland, told Health. Fevers can be cyclical, meaning they go up and down. For example, you may begin to sweat when a fever breaks or comes down.
Some of the most common signs and symptoms of a fever include:
* Chills
* Flushed skin that is warm to the touch
* Increased heart rate
* Muscle spasms

* Sweating (e.g., night sweats)
Infants and children may show other signs and symptoms of a fever, such as:14
* A lack of appetite
* Earache (e.g., a child may pull at their ears)
* Fussiness, high-pitching crying, and whimpering
* Painful, swollen joints
* Pale skin
* Severe headache
* Skin rash
* Sore throat
* Swollen soft spot on an infant's head
   * Upset stomach At-Home Treatment
A slightly elevated body temperature is not typically a cause for concern. You may want to take steps to lower, rather than suppress, your fever.
Here are a few things you can do to help make yourself comfortable while the fever runs its course:
* Avoid bundling up in blankets or excess clothing.
* Do not force food if you or your child do not have an appetite, but eat if you are hungry.
* Get plenty of rest.
* Keep your room comfortable. Use a fan to cool down the room if it's too hot.
* Stay hydrated with gelatine, ice pops, soup, and water.
* Take fever reducers like Advil (ibuprofen), aspirin, and Tylenol (acetaminophen). Follow the instructions on the label for using fever reducers. Do not give Advil to an infant younger
than 6 months or aspirin to a child younger than 18.
When To Contact a Healthcare Provider
Contact a healthcare provider if you have a 103-105 degrees or higher fever that does not go away with at-home treatments and persists for longer than 48-72 hours.
For infants and children, contact a healthcare provider if:
* Your infant is 3 months or younger with a rectal temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher
* Your infant is 3-12 months with a 102.2-degree or higher fever
* Your child has a 105-degree or higher fever that does not go away with at-home treatments
* Your child is 2 or younger with a fever that does not go away after 24-48

   * Your child is older than 2 with a fever longer than 48-72 hours Call a healthcare provider right away if you or your infant or child have:
* A cough, earache, or sore throat (for infants and children)
* A fever that comes and goes for one week or longer
* A weak immune system (i.e., due to cancer treatment or spleen removal)
* An underlying health condition (i.e., a chronic lung problem, diabetes, and heart disease)
* New bruises or rash
* Pain while urinating
* Recently been vaccinated (for infants and children)
* Recently travelled abroad
When To Seek Immediate Medical Attention
Get medical attention right away if you or your infant or child has:
* A stiff neck
* An inability to wake up
* An inability to walk
* Blue lips, nails, or tongue
* Confusion
* Crying and cannot calm down (for infants and children)
* Seizures
* Trouble breathing
   * Will not move their arms or legs (for infants and children) A Quick Review
A fever is typically a sign of an illness or infection, such as COVID-19. Healthcare providers generally consider a body temperature of 100-100.4 degrees a fever in adults. Infants and children have a fever if they have an oral temperature of 99.5 degrees or a rectal temperature of 100.4 degrees.
Mild fevers typically resolve with at-home treatments, like getting plenty of rest and staying hydrated. Consult a healthcare provider if you or your child has a high fever of 103-105 degrees
that does not resolve with treatment after a couple of days. Always contact a healthcare provider if your infant has a fever of 100.4 degrees.


Infection is usually the cause of fever
The cause of fever is usually an infection of some kind. This could include:

* diseases caused by viruses - such as colds, flu, COVID-19 or other upper respiratory tract infections
* diseases caused by bacteria - such as tonsillitis, pneumonia or urinary tract infections
* some chronic illnesses - such as rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis can cause fevers that last for longer periods
* some tropical diseases - such as malaria, which can cause bouts of recurring fever or typhoid fever
* heat stroke - which includes fever (without sweating) as one of its symptoms
* drugs - some people may be susceptible to fever as a side effect of particular drugs.

Self-treatment suggestions for fever Suggestions to treat fever include:
* Take paracetamol or ibuprofen in appropriate doses to help bring your temperature down.
* Drink plenty of fluids, particularly water.
* Avoid alcohol, tea and coffee as these drinks can cause slight dehydration.
* Sponge exposed skin with tepid water. To boost the cooling effect of evaporation, you could try standing in front of a fan.
* Avoid taking cold baths or showers. Skin reacts to the cold by constricting its blood vessels, which will trap body heat. The cold may also cause shivering, which can generate more heat.
   * Make sure you have plenty of rest, including bed rest. When to see your doctor for fever symptoms
You should always consult with your doctor in the following cases:
* You are still feverish after 3 days, despite home treatment.
* Your temperature is over 40°C.
* You are shivering and shaking involuntarily, or your teeth are chattering.
* You seem to be getting sicker as time goes by.
* You have unusual symptoms such as hallucinations, vomiting, neck stiffness, skin rash, rapid heart rate, chills or muscle spasms.
* You feel confused and drowsy.
* You have a severe headache that doesn't respond to painkillers.
* You have recently travelled overseas.

When to seek immediate urgent medical attention
You should seek immediate medical attention if you or someone else has the following symptoms:

* fever with headache and a stiff neck
* rash that does not blanche to skin pressure (indicates bleeding into the skin) - this can be a sign of a life-threatening illness.
Diagnosis methods
Since fever is a symptom and not an illness, the underlying cause must be found before specific
treatment can begin. Some tests may be necessary if the cause of the fever is not clear after your doctor has taken a medical history and performed an examination. These tests may include:
* blood tests
* urine examination and culture
* throat swabs or mucus sample examination and culture
* stool examination and culture
* x-rays.

Treatment options
Treatment depends on the cause - for example, chronic tonsillitis may require surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy).
Fevers caused by viral illnesses shouldn't be treated with antibiotics, since these drugs have no effect against viruses. In cases of mild bacterial infection, it is usually best to allow your immune system to handle the problem, rather than take antibiotics.
Fever in children
On average, a child has up to 10 infections per year.
Body temperature isn't a reliable indicator of illness for babies and young children - a child may have a mild temperature according to the thermometer (slightly over 37°C), but seem happy and healthy.
See a doctor right away if your child:
* is aged six months or less
* has a rash
* has a fever of 40°C or more
* is still feverish after a day or so, despite 4-hourly doses of baby paracetamol
* vomits or has persistent diarrhoea
* refuses food or drink
* cries inconsolably
* seems listless, floppy or just looks ill
* convulses or twitches
* has trouble breathing

* is in pain.
If you feel at all worried or concerned at any stage, consult with your doctor. Treatment for fever in children
* Dress your child in light clothing.
* Give drinks of clear fluid (like water).
* Keep your child cool.
* Give paracetamol in the correct dose for the child's age (but not more than 4 doses in a 24- hour period). Do not give regular paracetamol medicine for more than 24 hours without seeking advice from your doctor.
* See your doctor if your child is 3 months or younger.
   * Don't give your child a cold bath. Fever can cause convulsions
A febrile convulsion is a fit or seizure that occurs in babies and children when they have a high fever, usually from an ear infection or a viral upper respiratory infection. The fit can last a few seconds or up to 15 minutes, and is followed by drowsiness.
Approximately 3% of otherwise healthy children will have one or more febrile convulsions
between the ages of 6 months and 6 years. A febrile convulsion is not epilepsy and does not cause brain damage. There is no way to predict who will be affected or when this will happen.
The symptoms of febrile convulsion include:
* loss of consciousness (black out) - the child will fall if standing and may pass urine
* twitching or jerking of arms and legs
* breathing difficulty
* foaming at the mouth
* going pale or bluish in skin colour
* eye rolling, so only the whites of their eyes are visible
* your child may take 15 minutes to wake up properly afterwards - they may be irritable and appear not to recognise you.
Convulsions are rarely serious. If your child has a convulsion, you should:
* Try to stay calm and don't panic.
* Place your child on the floor and remove any objects they could knock against.
* Don't force anything into your child's mouth.
* Don't shake, slap or try to restrain your child.

* Once the convulsion has stopped, roll your child onto their side, also known as the recovery position. If there is food in their mouth, turn their head to the side, and do not try to remove it.
* Note what time the fit started and stopped, so you can tell the doctor.
* Have your child checked by your local doctor or nearest hospital emergency department as soon as possible after the fit stops to find the cause of the fever.
Infection
Most bacteria that affect humans flourish in normal or near normal body temperatures. When you have an infection, your immune system raises your body's temperature to stifle the growth of the invading microorganisms.
Both viral and bacterial infections can cause a high fever. Infections with a high fever as a symptom include:
* appendicitis
* cellulitis
* encephalitis
* meningitis
* osteomyelitis
* pneumonia
* respiratory infections
   * UTIs Other symptoms
Your doctor will evaluate all of your symptoms to determine the specific infection that may be causing your high fever. Other symptoms that may indicate an infection and may occur with a high fever include:
* sweats and chills
* a sore throat
* abdominal pain
* shortness of breath
* a stuffy nose
* neck stiffness
* a change in urination or pain while urinating
* vomiting
* diarrhoea
* a new cough or a worsening cough

* unusual vaginal discharge

Heat exhaustion occurs when your body temperature rises and your body is not able to cool itself quickly. You may develop heat exhaustion from working or exercising in hot temperatures, particularly if you do not drink enough water.


On its own, heat exhaustion is usually not serious. However, it can lead to heat stroke, which is a life-threatening medical emergency.
Symptoms of heat exhaustion include a fever of 101ºF (38ºC) or higher. Other symptoms may include:
* a headache
* a fast pulse
* rapid breathing
* excessive sweating
* extreme thirst
* dizziness
* confusion
Children under 4 years and adults over 65 years have a higher risk of heat-related illness. Talk with your doctor or your child's paediatrician about steps to reduce the risk of heat exhaustion.

Drug reaction
Certain medications can cause a high fever as a side effect, known as a drug fever. In some cases, a fever may be the only adverse reaction a person experiences from a drug.
If you have an unexplained high fever, talk with your doctor or pharmacist about any medications you are taking. They can help determine if your fever is a side effect and discuss alternative
treatment options if needed. Non-infectious conditions
Several non-infectious conditions can cause a high fever as a symptom.
Your doctor will ask about all of your symptoms to help make an accurate diagnosis. If you already have a diagnosis, tell your doctor about any high fever or other symptoms you experience.
Non-infectious causes of a high fever include:
* cancer
* Crohn's disease
* gout
* rheumatoid arthritis
* systemic lupus erythematosus

* ulcerative colitis
* vasculitis

Fever of unknown origin
Fever of unknown origin (FUO) occurs when someone has had a fever for at least 3 weeks without a clear indication of the cause after a week of in-hospital evaluation.
Most times, doctors eventually identify an underlying cause, and it is typically an undiagnosed infection. In about 10% of adults with FUO, however, doctors are unable to determine the cause.

How is a high fever different in children?
Paediatricians have different guidelines related to fever for children based on their age.
Although there are several types of thermometers that parents and caregivers can use, doctors consider a rectal temperature to be the most accurate reading.

When evaluating fever in infants, doctors generally define a rectal temperature of 100.4ºF (38ºC) as clinically significant.
Newborns (0-3 months)
Any infant younger than 3 months who has a fever should receive medical care, even if they appear to have no other symptoms.
Infants at this age could be at high risk of infection or complications simply due to their age.

Young children (3 months to 3 years)
Guidelines from the American Academy of Family Physicians state that doctors should consider children in this age group to be at high risk if they have a fever along with symptoms including:
* rapid breathing or difficulty breathing
* difficulty waking or being roused from sleep
* slow refill of colour (more than 2 seconds) to the fingertips if pressed
* petechiae, which is a rash of tiny spots that appear due to bleeding under the skin

School-aged children (3 years and older)
For children of this age, home care is typically effective in managing a fever. Management steps include:
* allowing the child to rest
* providing the child with plenty of fluids
* giving the child acetaminophen or ibuprofen, following the dosage guidance on the label
* keeping the child in light clothing
* watching for symptoms of dehydration, such as a dry mouth or a lack of tears when crying

Febrile seizure

A febrile seizure is a seizure that occurs primarily in children due to a high fever. They are most common with fevers of 102ºF (38.9ºC) or higher, but they can occur with milder fevers as well.

Symptoms of a febrile seizure include:
* stiffness
* twitching
* eye rolling
* unresponsiveness
* a change in skin colour
* changes in breathing
A febrile seizure typically lasts 1-2 minutes, and then the child quickly returns to their typical self. In adults
Adults should seek medical attention for a high fever if they experience:
* extreme thirst
* reduced urine output
* severe muscle cramps
* light-headedness
* weakness
* a fever after international travel
* a fever with a diagnosed chronic condition, such as cancer or HIV
   * a fever with a weakened immune system Heat exhaustion
Because heat exhaustion can progress to heat stroke, seek immediate medical care (call 112) for symptoms of heat exhaustion. You can provide first aid for someone with heat exhaustion by:
* moving the person to a shaded or cooler area
* giving the person frequent sips of cool water
* removing unnecessary clothing, such as shoes and socks
* applying cool compresses
   * having the person wash their face, neck, and head with cold water Heat stroke
Symptoms of heat stroke in people of any age indicate a life-threatening emergency. Call 112 for symptoms including:
* a temperature of 106ºF (41ºC) or higher

* a loss of consciousness
* profuse sweating
* hot, dry skin
* seizures

What treatments are available for a high fever?
Treatment for a high fever often relies on treating the underlying cause. Infection
For bacterial infections, treatment typically consists of antibiotics. Viral infections typically improve with time and home care, including rest, fluids, and over-the-counter (OTC) medications.
Sepsis
Sepsis can progress to septic shock, which is a life-threatening emergency. Seek urgent medical care if you have symptoms of sepsis.
Rapid treatment for sepsis includes antibiotics to treat the underlying infection and medications that maintain blood flow to vital organs.
Drug reaction
If your fever is an adverse effect of a specific medication you are taking, your doctor can recommend alternative treatment options
Is drinking cold water good for fever?
Your body can become dehydrated when you have a fever, so drinking any kind of water is beneficial. Staying hydrated also helps your immune system fight off the infection causing the fever. Steps to cool yourself during a fever include wearing light clothing and taking OTC fever- reducing medications.
A fever is a temperature greater than or equal to 100.4º F or 38º C. Fever in children is very common. Fever is a normal body response that helps the body fight infections.
The information in this video is for otherwise healthy children older than 3 months. If your child is younger than 3 months old, or has a health problem that makes infection more likely, always call your child's doctor for advice when your child has a fever.
Your child's temperature is not the most important thing to monitor when your child has a fever. Most of the time you won't even need to take your child's temperature. Instead, pay attention to the symptoms your child is experiencing along with the fever.
These are normal symptoms: Faster heart rate and breathing; shivering; cold hands and feet; head and body aches; tired and fussy; poor appetite. You don't necessarily need to call the doctor if your child has these symptoms.
These are abnormal symptoms: Extremely sleepy or irritable; trouble breathing; rashes; pain, redness or swelling in one area (like a sore throat or a red, swollen knee); drinking very little or not at all; severely decreased urination; fever lasting longer than 3 days; seizure. You should call the

doctor if your child has any of these symptoms, or if your instincts are telling you something isn't right.
In general, call the doctor if your child is:
* younger than 3 months old with a rectal temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher
* 3 months or older with a temperature higher than 102.2°F (39°C)
   * any age but has a health problem like cancer or sickle cell disease and has a fever Also call the doctor if your child is 3 months or older, has a fever, and:
* refuses fluids or seems too ill to drink enough
* has lasting diarrhoea or repeated vomiting
* has any signs of dehydration (peeing less than usual, not having tears when crying, less alert and less active than usual)
* has a specific complaint (like a sore throat or earache)
* still has a fever after 2-3 days
* has a rash
* has pain while peeing
Get emergency care if your child shows any of these signs:
* crying that won't stop
* extreme irritability or fussiness
* sluggishness and trouble waking up
* a rash or purple spots that look like bruises on the skin (that were not there before your child got sick)
* blue lips, tongue, or nails
* in an infant, the soft spot on the head seems to be bulging out or sunken in
* stiff neck
* severe headache
* limpness or refusal to move
* trouble breathing that doesn't get better when the nose is cleared
* leaning forward and drooling
* seizure
   * moderate to severe belly pain What Else Should I Know?

All kids get fevers, and in most cases they're back to normal within a few days. For older babies and kids, the way they act can be more important than the reading on your thermometer.
Everyone gets a little cranky when they have a fever. This is normal and should be expected.
But if you're ever in doubt about what to do or what a fever might mean, or if your child is acting ill in a way that concerns you even with no fever, always call your doctor for advice.

When to see a doctor
If your baby is under three months and has a fever above 38°C, then you should take them to a doctor or emergency department as soon as possible.
If your child is immunocompromised (has a weakened immune system) for any reason and has a fever above 38°C, you should seek immediate care from your doctor or hospital emergency department.
For all other children, take them to see a GP if their temperature is above 38°C and they have any of the following symptoms:
* a stiff neck or light is hurting their eyes
* vomiting and refusing to drink much
* a rash
* more sleepy than usual
* problems with breathing
   * pain that doesn't get better with pain relief medication. Also take your child to a GP if they:
* have had any fever for more than two days and there's no obvious cause
* seem be getting more unwell
   * have had a febrile seizure OTHER DISEASES RELATED TO FEVER:
Kawasaki disease (KD) is characterized by the characteristic fever over 5 days along with some of the following findings:
* Swelling or redness of the hands and feet, followed by peeling of the tips of the toes or fingers
* Red rash all over
* Redness and crusting of the lips or redness of the tongue (like a strawberry)
* Severe pink eye
* Swollen lymph nodes of the neck

Kawasaki disease causes swelling, called inflammation, in the walls of small to medium-sized blood vessels that carry blood throughout the body. Kawasaki disease most often affects the heart arteries in children. Those arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart.


Kawasaki disease is sometimes called mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. That's because it also causes swelling in glands, called lymph nodes, and mucous membranes inside the mouth, nose, eyes and throat.


Children with Kawasaki disease might have high fever, swollen hands and feet with skin peeling, and red eyes and tongue. But Kawasaki disease is often treatable. With early treatment, most children get better and have no long-lasting problems.
Symptoms
Symptoms of Kawasaki disease include a fever greater than 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius) for five or more days. And the child has at least four of the following symptoms.
* A rash on the main part of the body or in the genital area.
* An enlarged lymph node in the neck.
* Very red eyes without a thick discharge.
* Red, dry, cracked lips and a red, swollen tongue.
* Swollen, red skin on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Later the skin on fingers and toes peels.
The symptoms might not happen at the same time. Let your child's healthcare professional know about a symptom that has gone away.
Other symptoms might include:
* Belly pain.
* Diarrhoea.
* Fussiness.
* Joint pain.
* Vomiting.
Some children get a high fever for five or more days but have fewer than four of the symptoms needed for a diagnosis of Kawasaki disease. They might have what's called incomplete Kawasaki disease. Children with incomplete Kawasaki disease are still at risk of damage to the heart arteries. They still need treatment within 10 days of when symptoms appear.
Kawasaki disease can have symptoms like those of a condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. The syndrome happens in children with COVID-19.
When to see a doctor

If your child has a fever that lasts more than three days, contact your child's healthcare professional. Treating Kawasaki disease within 10 days of when it began may reduce the chances of lasting damage to the arteries that supply the heart


Fever is common in both bacterial and viral gastroenteritis. High fever is commonly present in many bacterial causes (e.g. Shigella, Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli). Fever is often absent or low-grade in other diseases (e.g. enteropathogenic E. coli, cholera). Other febrile conditions cause diarrhoea and need to be differentiated.


Fever in URTI (Viral Upper Respiratory Tract Infection)
* Fever in URTI is present in about 50% of older children and in 90% of infants and young children.
* Although high degrees of fever occur in viral and bacterial infections, high fever may predict serious bacterial infection.
* High fever (>39.5 °C) is often associated with influenza A virus infections, occurring in more than 50% of children. Adenovirus infection causes fever exceeding 40 °C in about 20%, while fever in rhinovirus infection is usually absent or mild.
* Fever associated with respiratory virus infection may last for 3-5 days. A prolonged duration of fever is however common. Fever lasting 5 days or longer occurs in over 30% of children with this infection. The longest duration of fever (>7 days) may occur in association with adenovirus. The shortest duration of fever is associated with parainfluenza 2 viruses.
* Fever enhances body's immunity against infection, and antipyretics may negatively affect the outcome of the illness. Therefore, antipyretics should only be given for symptomatic children, such as discomfort, and not for fever per se.
   * Recurrent URTIs are mostly caused by viruses obtained from nursery attendance. Other:
* Allergic rhinitis. There is often a family history of atopy, a history of nasal symptoms with exposure to potential allergens and the symptoms tend to be persistent. Nasal eosinophilia, increased serum IgE level and the finding of possible allergens in skin prick tests or blood may confirm the diagnosis.
* Streptococcal throat infection. Children are usually >5 years. Fever tends to be higher than that in URTI. Nasal symptoms are usually absent.
* Sinusitis should be considered in a child with purulent nasal discharge and fever (usual range 38-39 °C), localized pain and tenderness, mucosal erythema and headache, whereas a higher fever with chills may suggest an extension of the infection beyond the sinuses.


MEDICATIONS THAT CAN BE TAKEN:

A fever is a common sign of illness, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, fevers seem to play a key role in fighting infections. So, should you treat a fever or let the fever run its course? Here's help making the call.
These recommendations are for people who are generally healthy - for instance, those who are not immunocompromised or taking chemotherapy drugs and haven't recently had surgery.
The values listed in the table below are for temperatures taken with rectal and oral thermometers.
These thermometers provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Other types of thermometers, such as ear (tympanic membrane) or forehead (temporal artery)
thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements.

Acetaminophen

Acetaminophen, commonly sold under the brand name Tylenol, is a non-opioid analgesic and antipyretic agent to treat pain and fever. Companies often add Trusted Source acetaminophen to other medications that treat allergies, colds, flu, and other medical conditions.

Acetaminophen is available OTC or as a prescription.
For teenagers and adults, it commonly comes in the form of tablets and capsules. Younger children may be able to take it in a liquid form, but caregivers should speak with a paediatrician first.
Side effects
The United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS) states that side effects are rare in adults and children if a person takes the correct dose.

However, in rare cases, a person can experience an allergic reaction.

Precautions
In some cases, NSAIDs can lead to serious adverse effects, including problems affecting the liver, heart, and blood circulation.
Compared to prescription-strength medications, OTC NSAIDs typically cause fewer side effects.

Acetaminophen can lead Trusted Source to liver failure or other issues with the liver.

People can also experience an allergic reaction to fever-reducing medications. People should seek medical help if they experience:
* rash
* inflamed, peeling, or blistering skin
* itching
* hives
* hoarse voice
* difficulty swallowing
* difficulty breathing
   * swelling of the face, tongue, throat, lips, hands, feet, eyes, lower legs, or ankles A person should take fever-reducing medications only as a medical professional advises. How to take the medication
There are several formulas of NSAIDs and acetaminophen with differing doses. A person should follow the instructions on the packaging and pay attention to the maximum number of doses allowed in 24 hours.
When treating an underlying condition, a person should follow the doctor's recommendations regarding how much to take and when to take it.
A person should also be mindful of other medications that may contain acetaminophen. Companies often mix Trusted Source it with other ingredients to create OTC medications for colds, flu, and other issues.

Can a person take acetaminophen and NSAIDs at the same time?
A person can take acetaminophen and ibuprofen at the same time. Learn more about acetaminophen and ibuprofen.
Other options to treat fever
A person may find that certain home remedies may help reduce their fever. Other options include:
* resting
* taking lukewarm baths
* drinking plenty of fluids
* wearing loose clothing
A fever breaks when a person's temperature drops below 100.4ºF (38°C)Trusted Source, but they may still feel ill due to the underlying condition. Dropping the fever can help alleviate some symptoms and help people feel better overall.

When to contact a doctor for a fever
A person should seek medical help if they are unable to lower the fever on their own or if they suspect a more serious underlying condition. They should also contact a doctor if:
* a person experiences worsening symptoms
* they have a weakened immune system
* they reach a fever of 104°F (40ºC) or higher
* they are concerned about a fever in a child or older adult
There are two main medications to help relieve fevers. These are acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen. It's important to compare products and choose the one that is best for your child's specific condition and fever.
When you or your child has a fever, you want something that works quickly and works well. But with so many over-the-counter (OTC) medications available, it can be tough to know which one is best for you.
You can choose between two main types of OTC fever reducers: acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs include ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen. In general, no particular one of these fever-reducing drugs is better than the others. Instead, you should compare

the drug forms, side effects, and other factors to choose a fever reducer that will work well for you or your child. Here's what you need to know to make an informed decision.
Acetaminophen (Tylenol)
Acetaminophen is a fever reducer and a pain reliever. It's not fully understood how this drug works. Acetaminophen doesn't decrease swelling or inflammation. Instead, it likely changes the way your body senses pain. It also helps cool your body to bring your fever down.
Forms and brand-name versions
Acetaminophen comes in several forms. These include:
* tablets
* extended-release tablets
* chewable tablets
* disintegrating tablets
* capsules
* liquid solution or suspension
* syrup
You take any of these forms by mouth. Acetaminophen is also available as a rectal suppository. Common brand-name drugs that contain acetaminophen include Tylenol, Feverall, and Mapap. Find acetaminophen online.
Side effects
When taken as directed, acetaminophen is generally safe and well-tolerated. However, in some cases, it can cause side effects such as:
* nausea
* vomiting
* trouble sleeping
* allergic reaction
   * serious skin reactions, including severe rash Warnings
Overdose
Because acetaminophen is found in many over-the-counter medications, it's easy to take too much of it. That makes overdose a concern. You should not take more than 4,000 mg of acetaminophen in a 24-hour period.
This limit includes acetaminophen from all sources, including over-the-counter and prescription forms. Other common OTC drugs that contain acetaminophen include Alka-Seltzer Plus, Dayquil,

Nyquil, Excedrin, Robitussin, and Sudafed. To be safe, avoid taking more than one product that contains acetaminophen at a time.
In case of overdose, call your local poison control centre or 112 right away. Liver damage
If you take too much acetaminophen, it can also cause liver damage. In severe cases, this can lead to liver failure, the need for a liver transplant, or death. Again, only take one medication that contains acetaminophen at a time, and always carefully follow the dosage instructions on the medication package.
Alcohol
Taking acetaminophen and drinking alcohol can also cause liver damage. In general, you should not take acetaminophen if you have three or more drinks that contain alcohol every day.
Extended fever or drug reaction
Stop taking acetaminophen if your fever gets worse or lasts more than three days. Also stop using it if you develop new symptoms such as skin redness or swelling. In these cases, call your doctor right away. They could be a sign of a more serious condition.
Drug interactions
Acetaminophen can interact with other drugs. An interaction is when a substance changes the way a drug works. This can be harmful or prevent the drug from working well. Examples of drugs that can cause dangerous interactions when used with acetaminophen include:
* warfarin, a blood thinner
* isoniazid, a tuberculosis drug
   * certain seizure medications such as carbamazepine and phenytoin Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) include drugs such as:
* ibuprofen
* aspirin
* naproxen
NSAIDs help decrease inflammation, pain, and fever. They do this by blocking the body's production of a substance called prostaglandin. This substance promotes inflammation and fever by causing the release of various chemical signals in your body.
Forms and brand-name versions Ibuprofen
Ibuprofen comes in several forms. These include:
* tablets
* chewable tablets

* capsules
* liquid suspension
You take ibuprofen by mouth. Common brand-name products that contain ibuprofen include Advil and Motrin.
Shop for ibuprofen on Amazon.

Aspirin
Aspirin comes in these forms:
* tablets
* delayed-release tablets
* chewable tablets
* gum
You take any of these forms by mouth. Aspirin also comes as a rectal suppository. Common brand- name products that contain aspirin include Bayer Aspirin and Ecotrin.
Purchase aspirin here.

Naproxen
Naproxen comes in these forms:
* tablets
* delayed-release tablets
* capsules
* liquid suspension
You take naproxen by mouth. A common brand-name product that contains naproxen is Aleve. Find naproxen online.
Side effects
The most common side effect of NSAIDs is an upset stomach. To help prevent stomach upset, take ibuprofen or naproxen with food or milk. You can take aspirin with food or a full glass of water.
NSAIDs can also have more serious side effects. The more serious side effects of ibuprofen or naproxen can include:
* stomach problems such as bleeding and ulcers
* heart problems such as heart attack and stroke
* kidney problems
The more serious side effects of aspirin can include:
* stomach problems such as bleeding and ulcers

* allergic reactions, with symptoms such as:
o breathing trouble
o wheezing
o swelling of face
o hives
o shock
Warnings
Talk with your doctor before taking an NSAID if any of these warnings pertain to you. History of heart disease
If you have a history of heart disease, you have increased risk of heart attack or stroke when taking ibuprofen or naproxen. The risk is still higher if you take more of these medications than directed or if you take them for a long time.
History of stomach ulcers or bleeding problems
If this applies to you, you have an increased risk of ulcers or bleeding when taking ibuprofen or naproxen. The risk is still higher if you:
* take these medications for a long time
* take other medications that contain NSAIDs
* take any blood thinner drugs or steroids
* are 60 years or older
Extended fever or drug reaction
There are several instances that indicate you should not continue to treat your fever with an NSAID. Stop taking NSAIDs if:
* your fever gets worse or lasts more than three days
* you develop any new symptoms
* you have skin redness or swelling
* you have ringing in your ears or hearing loss
   * you have signs of a stomach bleed Signs of stomach bleeding include:
* faintness
* blood in your vomit or vomit that looks like coffee grounds
* bloody or black stools
* stomach pain that does not improve

Stop taking the drug and call your doctor if you have any of these symptoms. These effects could be signs of a more serious condition.
Alcohol
If you have three or more drinks that contain alcohol per day, you're at higher risk of ulcers or bleeding when taking ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen. Taking NSAIDs and drinking alcohol can cause severe stomach problems.
Problems in children
Avoid using aspirin in children and adolescents who are younger than 12 years and are recovering from chickenpox or flu symptoms.
Call your child's doctor right away if your child has nausea and vomiting along with certain behaviour changes. These include aggressive behaviour, confusion, or loss of energy. These behaviour changes may be early signs of a rare condition called Reye's syndrome. If left untreated, Reye's syndrome can be life-threatening.

Drug interactions
NSAIDs can interact with other medications you may be taking. For example, NSAIDs can interact with:
* warfarin, a blood thinner
* celecoxib, another NSAID
* cyclosporine, a drug that weakens your immune system
   * diuretics and other medications to treat high blood pressure Drug guidelines by age
Fever reducers can affect people of different ages differently. Follow these age guidelines to help determine which fever reducer is best for you or your child.
Adults (ages 18 years and older)
Acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin are generally safe for reducing fever in adults. Children (ages 4-17 years)
Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are generally safe for reducing fever in children who are 4-17 years old.
Do not give aspirin to children unless your doctor says it's okay.
Naproxen is safe in children ages 12 years and older. If your child is younger than 12 years of age, talk to your doctor before giving your child naproxen.
Children (ages 3 years and younger)
Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are generally safe for reducing fever in young children. However, be sure to talk to your child's doctor first if your child is younger than 2 years.

Do not give aspirin to young children unless your doctor says it's okay.
For infants younger than 3 months, call your doctor first before giving any medication. What Type of Medicine Reduces Fever?
Whether you have a low-grade fever or severe, you should always understand your medication options first. Fever-reducing medications fall primarily into two categories: antipyretics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Antipyretics, such as acetaminophen, work directly on the brain's temperature-regulating centre (the hypothalamus) to lower body temperature. They're highly effective in reducing fever and alleviating associated discomfort.
NSAIDs, including ibuprofen and aspirin, not only reduce fever but they also possess anti- inflammatory properties. These ingredients can be particularly beneficial when fever is accompanied by inflammation during infections.
NSAID medications work by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are responsible for the body's inflammatory response.
Types of Fever Reducers
There are several types of fever reducers, each with its own mechanism of action and suitability for different situations. The most common types of fever reducers include acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and aspirin.
Acetaminophen
One of the most commonly used antipyretic medications is acetaminophen. Acetaminophen is known for its fever-reducing properties and is a popular choice for adults and children. It's available in various forms, including liquid and tablets, making it convenient and easy to administer.
Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)
Ibuprofen has excellent fever-reducing properties. They work by preventing the production
of certain chemicals in the body, causing inflammation and fever. These medications are often used to provide relief from symptoms like headaches and muscle aches. Use NSAIDs cautiously, as they may have side effects, especially if taken in high doses or over an extended period.
Aspirin
A type of NSAID, aspirin, can also be used as a fever reducer. According to the Cleveland Clinic, NSAIDs work by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which helps lower body temperature. Aspirin has been widely used for its fever-reducing and anti-inflammatory properties.
However, aspirin isn't recommended for children or teenagers with fever due to the risk of Reye's syndrome- a rare but serious condition.

When choosing a fever reducer, it's important to consider factors like your age, medical history, and any existing medical conditions. Consult with a healthcare professional or pharmacist to determine the most suitable fever reducer for your specific situation.
Fever Reducers for Children

For children's fever, you want the best medicine, starting with a fever reducer. Fever reducers for children are essential tools for managing their body temperature and discomfort from related symptoms.
Acetaminophen for Minors
One of the most commonly recommended options for children is acetaminophen. This fever reducer is available in liquid form and suitable for various age groups, making it easier to administer to children. It's crucial to follow the dosing instructions carefully, as the correct dosage depends on the child's age and weight.
Acetaminophen not only reduces fever but it also relieves pain. It's often used to manage common childhood ailments like colds and flu.

Mucinex(r) Children's Cold & Flu (All-in-One) Very Berry Flavour is an effective children's fever reducer while alleviating sore throat, headache, sinus pressure, and more.
Ibuprofen for Minors
Another option for reducing fever in children is ibuprofen, which is found in OTC medications. Ibuprofen is also available in liquid form, making it convenient for paediatric use. It's effective at lowering a child's temperature and has anti-inflammatory properties, providing relief from various pain-related symptoms.
As with acetaminophen, it's crucial to adhere to the recommended dosages based on the child's age and weight, and it should be administered with care to avoid any potential side effects.
However, according to the Mayo Clinic, ensure you avoid aspirin for children because it isn't typically recommended due to the risk of Reye's syndrome.
Fever Reducers for Adults
Fever reducers for adult's help alleviate discomfort and manage fever, which is often a symptom of various underlying conditions.
Acetaminophen for Adults
Among the most commonly used fever reducers for adults are acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and aspirin. A great option to reduce fever and alleviate headaches, body pain, sore throats, cough, chest congestion and nasal congestion symptoms is Mucinex(r) Maximum Strength Fast-Max(r) Cold, Flu & Sore Throat.

Acetaminophen is often used to manage common ailments such as colds, flu, and headaches. It is known for its effectiveness and relatively low risk of stomach irritation, making it a well-tolerated option for most people.
Ibuprofen for Adults
Ibuprofen is another common fever reducer for adults. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen have the dual benefit of reducing fever and alleviating inflammation and pain.
They work by halting enzymes that produce substances causing inflammation and fever. Like acetaminophen, use ibuprofen as directed and be mindful of any potential side effects, especially for those with specific medical conditions or medications that may interact with it.

Aspirin, a type of NSAID, is another option for adults to lower fever and reduce inflammation. For adults, aspirin can be a suitable choice, but like other fever-reducing medicines, it must be used with care, and it's important to be aware of potential side effects.
Is Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen Better for Fever?
When it comes to choosing between acetaminophen and ibuprofen for fever relief, there are several factors you should consider. Both medications are effective at reducing fever, but they work in slightly different ways.
Acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is primarily used for pain and fever reduction. It's considered a good option for those who can't tolerate anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen or have conditions that contraindicate their use. It's generally considered easier on the stomach and is often preferred when an individual has gastrointestinal sensitivities.
On the other hand, ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It not only reduces fever but it also has anti-inflammatory properties. This can be particularly beneficial if fever is accompanied by inflammation, such as in the case of some infections.
However, individuals with certain medical conditions, like peptic ulcers, might be advised to avoid NSAIDs due to their potential to irritate the stomach lining.
The choice between acetaminophen and ibuprofen for fever relief should also consider individual factors such as allergies, existing medical conditions, and current medications.
In many cases, either medication can effectively reduce fever, but consulting a healthcare professional is advisable, especially when dealing with high fevers, persistent symptoms, or for those with specific medical concerns.
My Fever Won't Go Down - What Should I Do?
There are many causes of a fever. When your fever persists and won't subside despite taking fever- reducing medication, it can be concerning. In such cases, there are several steps you can take to address the issue effectively.
Follow the Directions on Medication Labels Correctly
First and foremost, ensure you're using the medication correctly by following the recommended dosages and guidelines. Overdosing or not adhering to the instructions can lead to complications and may not provide the desired relief.
Consult a Healthcare Professional
If your fever persists or worsens, contact your doctor or other healthcare professional. A persistent fever may be a sign of an underlying medical condition that needs attention.
Your healthcare provider can help diagnose the cause of your elevated temperature and recommend the right treatment.
In some cases, additional testing or evaluation may be necessary to identify the root of the issue. Stay Hydrated
In the meantime, focus on getting plenty of fluids, getting plenty of rest, and keeping your body cool by wearing lightweight clothing and using a fan or a cool compress.

These measures can help alleviate discomfort while you work with a healthcare professional to determine the cause of your persistent fever and find the best course of action for a full recovery.
OTC Fever Reducer Medications
Fever-reducing medications are an effective way to treat fever and alleviate discomfort when you're sick. From acetaminophen to NSAIDs like ibuprofen to aspirin, there is a range of treatment options, each with unique features and considerations.
When using fever reducers, always follow dosing instructions carefully and consult with your doctor, when necessary, particularly in cases of persistent or severe fever. When you understand these medications, you can make better choices to manage your fever effectively and get back to health with greater comfort and ease.
Rest
If you or your child has a fever, rest is important. Any activity can raise your temperature.
A fever is a sign that your body is fighting off an infection. Not wasting energy on unnecessary activities allows the body to direct all of its efforts toward the task at hand.
Stay Hydrated
Drinking plenty of fluids is necessary to avoid dehydration during a fever. The higher the fever, the higher the risk of dehydration. Vomiting and decreased appetite are common during infections and illnesses too-and this can further increase the risk of dehydration.
Severe dehydration during a fever can lead to:
* Painful cramps
* Heat exhaustion
* A deadly drop in blood pressure
* Seizures, or a condition that involves changes in consciousness and involuntary movements
Drinking chilled fluids can also help bring down a fever.2 Water and sports drinks are good choices. Take a Lukewarm Bath
A lukewarm, not hot, bath can help reduce a fever and relax you so you can sleep better.3 Be sure to get out of the tub once the water starts to cool.
Avoid taking a cold bath or shower, and avoid using ice. A cold bath may sound like a good idea if you're burning up, but it can cause shivering that can increase-rather than decrease-core body temperature.1 Also, shivering consumes calories, which can make you exhausted if you aren't eating well due to illness.
How to Relax Before Bed

Stay Cool
When you have a fever, it can help to stay in a cool environment. Keep the temperature in the room low and wear loose-fitting clothes made of a light, breathable fabric. If you're

experiencing chills, it's okay to rest under your bed covers or wrap up in a blanket, but be careful not to overheat. If you're sweating, it's best not to stay in that warmer environment.
Placing a cooling cloth or cold pack on the forehead is a common way to bring down fever. But, if a fever is very high, a better approach may be to place a cold pack under the armpit or in the groin area where there are larger blood vessels.
Be sure to:5
* Wrap the cold pack in a cloth to avoid direct contact with the skin.
* Leave it in place for no longer than 10 to 15 minutes.
* Move the pack around constantly to avoid frostbite.

Don't use a cold pack on babies or small children who can't tell you when it feels too cold. Take Medicine
An antipyretic is a type of drug used to reduce fever. Antipyretics work quickly to reduce fever and can make you feel better for four to eight hours.
Many can be purchased over the counter, including Tylenol (acetaminophen) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like Advil (ibuprofen).

Most over-the-counter antipyretics can be used in adults and children, but doses will vary. If a child under 3 months of age has a fever, contact a paediatrician or a healthcare provider who specializes in the care of children before using any fever medication.6
Tylenol can be used in children as small as 24 pounds in weight, while Advil can be given to children 6 months or older.6
Aspirin Warning in Children
Unless your healthcare provider tells you otherwise, aspirin should be avoided in children and teens because it can lead to a potentially deadly condition known as Reye's syndrome.6

What to Take for Fever

What Not to Do
In addition to avoiding cold baths or showers, there are other things you should never do when you have a high fever.
* Alcohol rubdowns: An alcohol rubdown involves rubbing the body in isopropyl alcohol
(a.k.a. "rubbing alcohol"), which provides a cooling sensation as it evaporates. This remedy actually does nothing to reduce fever and may cause shivers. Even worse, the practice can lead to alcohol poisoning as the alcohol is absorbed through the skin.7
* Overmedicating: Taking high doses of fever medications-or taking them more often than prescribed-does not make them more effective. But it will increase the risk of side effects. Taking high doses of NSAIDs can lead to stomach upset and gastric bleeding. Taking too much Tylenol can harm the liver.
* Overlooking product labels: Before using any medication, be sure to read the product label. This is especially true with multi-symptom cold and flu remedies that often contain

acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Taking a separate dose of either of these drugs too close to the multi-symptom treatment can result in overdosing. Also, check if the product contains salicylates, a class of drugs used to reduce inflammation. Aspirin is the most common example. Cold and flu remedies containing this type of drug should be used with extreme caution in children and teens due to the risk of Reye's syndrome.6
Tylenol Overdose or Poisoning

When to Call a Healthcare Provider
A fever can be concerning at any age, and a high fever can be particularly scary. You may be unsure if it's time to get emergency medical attention or if it's okay to wait and see how things progress. In the end, the rules vary by age group.
Regardless, though, seek medical treatment if a fever is accompanied by severe headache, difficulty breathing, or other concerning symptoms.

A low-grade fever, or a temperature of 99.6 to 100.3 degrees F, is not always a cause for concern. It's always best to contact your child's paediatrician if you aren't sure whether their fever needs treatment, especially if they are under the age of 2 years.
When to See a Healthcare Provider for a Fever

When Is a Fever Too High in Adults?
For adults, a fever of 103 degrees F that does not respond to medication should be evaluated by a healthcare provider.
Seek immediate care if you also have symptoms such as:
* Severe headache
* Severe stomach pain
* Constant vomiting
* Trouble breathing
* Stiff neck
* Light sensitivity
* Chest pain
* Pain with urination
* Inability to urinate
* Unusual rash
* Mental confusion
* Seizures
Fever in Children Over Age 2 Years
Fevers in children are common. There is usually no cause for alarm as long as the child's behaviour is normal.

A fever over 103 degrees F should prompt a call to the paediatrician. You should seek immediate care if:
* The fever has lasted more than four or five days.
* The child is less responsive than usual or has poor eye contact with you.
* The fever is accompanied by severe headache, fatigue, vomiting, or other troubling symptoms
   * The child has a fever after having been left in a hot car. What to Do if Your Child Has a Fever
Fever in Infants and Babies (Up to Age 2 Years)
For infants and babies, an unexplained fever is always a concern. Seek immediate care if an infant younger than 3 months of age develops any fever, the child is not acting like themselves, or you are otherwise concerned.
A few guidelines:
* In infants under 3 months old, a temperature over 100.3 degrees F should be treated right away.
* In children between 3 months and 2 years old, a fever greater than 102.2 degrees F warrants a call to the paediatrician.
